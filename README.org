* Auth-Service
An authentication service from scratch in *Go*, designed to be used on my personal projects
on my homelab in *k8s*, the main goal of the service is to serve as a place where i can
authenticate users and manage sessions.

** JWT
Use Json Web Token as a way to manage user authentication, the tokens are signed with RSA 4096
and the public key is available for the other services that may need to validate the tokens, the
service  was developed to be behind a pod on k8s and not accesible to the world. I have other project
called entrance that its main purpose is to serve as a reverse proxy for this one.
